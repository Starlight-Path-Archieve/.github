## Starlight Path Archive
This is the collection of repositories that are deprecated from Starlight Path. If the repositories have a OSI license such as GNU GPL3, MIT, Apache, etc, then you may clone and push them to your own repository and develop them, given you follow the license rules.

If you wish for a project to be revived that was deprecated due to lack of support, use, etc, and not because we upgraded engines, frameworks, languages, etc, then contact us and we may be able to revive it.
